This is my front-end web developer portfolio

**Built With**
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

**Features**
- Showcases my main projects with a description, github repo & live site
- describes both my design & technical skills
- a small paragraph to let you know a little about me
- a contact component to send an email to me

**Purpose**
- To be a hub of what I'm capable of doing, I aim to continue to better my skills 
and continue to update my portfolio. Having my projects set up here will allow me 
to see how far I've grown
